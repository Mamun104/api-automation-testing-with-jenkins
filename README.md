### Step 3: Service logon credentials

When Installing Jenkins, it is recommended to install and run Jenkins as an independent windows service using a local or domain user as it is much safer than running Jenkins using LocalSystem(Windows equivalent of root) which will grant Jenkins full access to your machine and services.

To run Jenkins service using a local or domain user, specify the domain user name and password with which you want to run Jenkins, click on Test Credentials to test your domain credentials and click on Next.

Jenkins Service Logon Credentials

If you get Invalid Logon Error pop-up while trying to test your credentials, follow the steps explained here to resolve it.

### Step 4: Port selection

Specify the port on which Jenkins will be running, Test Port button to validate whether the specified port if free on your machine or not. Consequently, if the port is free, it will show a green tick mark as shown below, then click on Next.

## Post-installation setup wizard

- When you first access a new Jenkins instance, you are asked to unlock it using an automatically-generated password.

### Step 1

Browse to http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port you configured for Jenkins when installing it) and wait until the Unlock Jenkins page appears.

## Step 2

- The initial Administrator password should be found under the Jenkins installation path (set at Step 2 in Jenkins Installation).

- For default installation location to C:\Program Files\Jenkins, a file called initialAdminPassword can be found under C:\Program Files\Jenkins\secrets.

However, If a custom path for Jenkins installation was selected, then you should check that location for initialAdminPassword file.

## Step 4

- On the Unlock Jenkins page, paste this password into the Administrator password field and click Continue.
- Notes:
